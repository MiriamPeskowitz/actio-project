1. Set up models, citizen and action
2. Set up views. CRUD for action, login/signup for citizen, etc
3. Set up controllers, add to config.ru: ApplicationCont -- basic entrypoint and helpers, ActionController. CitizenConteoller for login. 
4. How to start? 
	Go through the RESTful process on Controllers and set up all the routes. When done, check on browser to see what's working or not. 
	FIX. Can i do this without the migrations? 

5. Views. Stub them out so I can follow the action
6. Look up these so I fully understand them:   validates_presence_of :username, :email, :password      has_secure_password
7. As I figure out the fields in actions/new.erb, then I'll know what the migrations should be.
