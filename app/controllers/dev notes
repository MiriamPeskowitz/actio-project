1. Set up models, citizen and action
2. Think about views. CRUD for action, login/signup for citizen, etc
3. Set up controllers, add to config.ru: ApplicationCont -- basic entrypoint and helpers, ActionController. CitizenConteoller for login. 
4. How to start? 
	Go through the RESTful process on Controllers and set up all the routes. When done, check on browser to see what's working or not. 
	FIX. Can i do this without the migrations? 

5. Views. Stub them out so I can follow the action
6. Look up these so I fully understand them:   validates_presence_of :username, :email, :password      has_secure_password
7. As I figure out the fields in actions/new.erb, then I'll know what the migrations should be. 



1.Need help: separating, so that you can only see your own data. SOLVED -- this was amazing -- by using the relationships: not @actions = Action.... but this, because current_user is the instantiation of the Citizen class, so it's basically Citizen.actions...: 
	get '/actions' do
		if logged_in?
			@actions = current_user.actions
			erb :'actions/index' 
		else 


2. seed data ? Didn't get to this. 
3. which one? redirect to "/actions/#{current_user.username}" # or actions/#{@action.slug} DONE - -slug is helpful for the browser url
4. debugging: show.erb DONE 
5. How to get to citizens/show.erb vs actions/show.erb DONE 
6..id vs user.id SOLVED: needed to be citizen_id. Tried to jerry-rig it, then changed it with a new migration

Finishing up: 

Make video of myself coding: 
	remind myself of how to make the video: 
		on zoom, record. 
			-- do it of making the goodbye.rb page 
Make video of a walk through: 
	zoom, record

Next: 
how to edit any one from your list? What is necessary to do this? Not for this project, but I'd like to know how. 
Add a post-Logout page that's inspirational (I made a goodbye.rb page -- do this on Tuesday, and record it. ) DONE
Add " here's what other people are doing " let's see: Action.all {|title| <%title%>}
